An alien who enjoys the Overclock, who sees the good and the order as nothing, who enjoys watching the death and pain of the world, who is keen on forming a bloody and brutal carnival with the flames of the explosion. He doesn't play by the rules, doesn't seek fame and fortune, and doesn't choose the means. The sobriety deep in his heart is leading him to a world feast that is still forming.



On the scorched earth, is the rebirth.</span><br /><br />
