For those who lack the talent of resonance but crave for power, Fractsidus has crossed the forbidden line of science, coupling human bodies with the limbs of Tacet Discord through special mechanical parts, making the followers' bodies abnormally tall, capable of easily setting up heavy cannons.

The frequency of Tacet Discord is increasingly distorting the followers' minds, eroding their bodies. They choose to wear masks to hide their ugly faces.</span><br /><br />
