                    <span class="description">The Iron Cavalry, born in the Port City of Guixu, sets a trial of courage for the intruders with the unceasing blaze.

Over the long years, the truth of history gradually burns out, and the knights who once marched forward with a song of death gradually mutate in the word of mouth of humans, becoming the messengers of fear.

"That is a knight who turns fear into fuel and brings disaster."

However, among the idle talks of the indigenous people of the Port City of Guixu, another rumor quietly spread.

"When you face that knight, please put away your fear, and return with the highest respect, and prove your courage to live towards death to him."</span><br /><br />
