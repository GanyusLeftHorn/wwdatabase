                    <span class="description">The mimicking bird that dwells in Whining Aix's Mire, its cry is like a mournful elegy.



It is said that the bird once had a mate, and their combined song was wonderfully pleasing to the ear. The old name of the pair is no longer known, but the rhythm of their song was recorded and preserved by humans.



Until the disappearance of one of the birds - the surviving bird mourns all day, and its mournful cry has earned it the name of Mourning Aix.



The Mourning Aix, having lost its mate, has become increasingly violent, no longer allowing anyone to step into the old love nest, but instead, it hovers in the high sky with its elegy, chasing the lost mirage in the clouds.</span><br /><br />
